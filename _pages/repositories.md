The Kaur Research Group promotes a safe, welcoming, and inclusive research environment. We aim to include equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) principles throughout all aspects of our group. We welcome and support self-motivated researchers from all cultural and gender groups and promote a bias-free professional environment. We thoughtfully design personalized training plans that align with the personal and professional goals of each researcher.

### Academic Integrity
- Scientific misconduct, including fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism, is strictly forbidden.
- Keep accurate and complete experimental records.
- Understand the limitations of your work/knowledge. Be open to learn from each other!

### Maintain a Safe and Shared Working Space
- Strictly follow lab safety procedures.
- Operate lab equipment only after receiving training from an expert and after discussion with the supervisor.
- Clean and organize personal space, experimental space, and shared equipment after use.
- Inform your supervisor of malfunctioning equipment ASAP and provide assistance in fixing the issue.

### Active Involvement
- Be proactive in designing your goals and experiments and discuss with your supervisor in meetings.
- Be well-prepared for meetings, show up on time. Inform your supervisor if there is any change in your schedules.
- Be considerate of others' schedules, providing sufficient notice when asking for help.
- We encourage collaboration amongst the group members and make space for equal participation during weekly group discussions for all the members.

### Keep Communication Professional and Effective
- Address issues directly, using concise language (in person and/or via email).
- Provide constructive feedback to others.
- Be open to feedback, accept responsibility for mistakes, and make corrections.

## Discrimination and Harassment
- The Kaur Group enforces a zero-tolerance policy on discrimination and harassment.
- Be mindful of implicit and unconscious bias.
- Avoid all bias based on race, gender, age, religion, ethnicity, nationality, sexual orientation, gender expression, gender identity, presence of disabilities, educational background, or other personal attributes.
- If you see or experience inappropriate conduct, speak up remembering the principles of this Code of Conduct.

## Engagement
All new members of our group will be encouraged to contribute to the code of guidance for a positive, engaging, and fun research environment!
