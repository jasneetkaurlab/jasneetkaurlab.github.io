Dr. Kaur’s current research focuses on design, synthesis, and characterization of novel nanostructured materials, such as two-dimensional materials and polymer composites for developing applications in clean energy technologies. 

At Kaur’s lab, we develop surface engineered multifunctional materials and study their structural, chemical, and electrochemical properties using advanced microscopic and spectroscopic techniques for creating components for energy storage and conversion devices, such as batteries, supercapacitors, and water electrolysers for green hydrogen production. 

We are also interested in creating advanced materials for applications in environmental remediation, such as water treatment and antimicrobial coatings.
